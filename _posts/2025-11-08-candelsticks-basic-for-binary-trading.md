Candlestick charts are the foundation of price action analysis. Whether you're trading binary options, forex, or crypto, understanding candlesticks helps you spot trends, reversals, and key decision zones.

## 📘 What Is a Candlestick?

Each candlestick represents **price movement over a specific time period** (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes). It shows:

- **Open**: Price at the start of the candle
- **Close**: Price at the end of the candle
- **High**: Highest price reached
- **Low**: Lowest price reached

### 🟩 Bullish Candle
- Close > Open
- Candle body is typically **green**
- Indicates upward momentum

### 🟥 Bearish Candle
- Close < Open
- Candle body is typically **red**
- Indicates downward momentum

## 🔍 How to Read Candlesticks

| Component     | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| **Body**      | Strength of the move (long body = strong move) |
| **Wicks**     | Price rejection zones (long wick = reversal risk) |
| **Color**     | Direction (green = bullish, red = bearish) |

> ✅ Strong candles with small wicks = high conviction  
> ⚠️ Doji or spinning tops = indecision
