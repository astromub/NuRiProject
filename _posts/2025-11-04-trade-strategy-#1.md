# 📊 Trade Strategy #1: AO + SMA  
**Date:** Nov 4, 2025  

---

## 🧠 Strategy Overview  
Using **Awesome Oscillator (AO)** + **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** for **10-second expiry trades**.

This strategy combines:

- **Awesome Oscillator (AO 100):** Measures momentum shifts using a long smoothing period  
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Identifies the prevailing trend direction  
- **1-Minute Candlestick Chart:** For signal clarity  
- **10-Second Expiry:** For ultra-short-term execution  

---

## 📈 Chart Setup  
- **Timeframe:** 1-minute candles  
- **Expiry:** 10 seconds  

### 🔍 Indicators  
- **Awesome Oscillator (AO):** Set to `100` (longer smoothing for clearer momentum)  
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Set to `20` or `50` (depending on volatility)  

---

## 🟢 BUY Entry Conditions  
Enter a **BUY** trade when:

- Price is **above the SMA** (trend is bullish)  
- AO histogram is **green and rising**, or **crosses above the zero line**  
- Recent candle **closes bullish** (confirmation)  

💡 *Optional filter:*  
Wait for AO to form a **“saucer” pattern** (two red bars followed by a green bar) **above zero** for stronger momentum confirmation.

---

## 🔴 SELL Entry Conditions  
Enter a **SELL** trade when:

- Price is **below the SMA** (trend is bearish)  
- AO histogram is **red and falling**, or **crosses below the zero line**  
- Recent candle **closes bearish**  

💡 *Optional filter:*  
Look for AO **“twin peaks” pattern** below zero for added confirmation.

## ⏱ Timing Tips  
- Trade only during **high-volume sessions** (e.g., London or New York open)  
- Avoid **ranging markets**—this strategy thrives in clear trends  
- Use **1–2 second delay** after signal confirmation to avoid false triggers  

---

## 🛡 Risk Management  
- Use **fixed trade size** or apply **anti-Martingale** (increase after wins)  
- Limit to **3 consecutive trades per signal**  
- Avoid trading during **news releases** or **low liquidity**  
- Use **ASTRONuRi Trade Tracker** to manage your trades effectively
